<h1> ðŸš€ Elevator System Simulation Using C# .NET </h1>


Overview
This project is a simulation of a two-floor elevator system, developed using C# .NET (Windows Forms). It demonstrates key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), design patterns, and GUI design principles.

Features
Two-Floor Navigation: Smooth transitions between floors.
State Design Pattern: Ensures robust and scalable control logic.
Timed Door Animations: Realistic open and close functionality.
Floor Position Display: Indicates the current floor using a custom interface.
SOLID Principles: Clean, extensible, and maintainable code structure.
How It Works
Navigation Buttons:
Up and Down buttons to move the elevator between floors.
Door Open and Door Close buttons for manual control.
Automatic Features:
Doors automatically open/close upon reaching a floor.
Floor position updates in real-time.
Timers:
Control animations for opening/closing the doors.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Visual Studio (preferably 2022 or later)
